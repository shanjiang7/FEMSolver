	abstract = {We propose a two-scale ﬁnite element method for the MongeAmp`ere equation with Dirichlet boundary condition in dimension d ≥ 2 and prove that it converges to the viscosity solution uniformly. The method is inspired by a ﬁnite diﬀerence method of Froese and Oberman, but is deﬁned on unstructured grids and relies on two separate scales: the ﬁrst one is the mesh size h and the second one is a larger scale that controls appropriate directions and substitutes the need of a wide-stencil. The main tools for the analysis are a discrete comparison principle and discrete barrier functions that control the behavior of the discrete solution, which is continuous piecewise linear, both close to the boundary and in the interior of the domain.},

	abstract = {We propose an extension to our monotone and convergent method for the Monge-Amp`ere equation in dimension d ≥ 2, that incorporates the idea of ﬁltered schemes. The method combines our original monotone operator with a more accurate non-monotone modiﬁcation, using an appropriately chosen ﬁlter. This results in a remarkable improvement of accuracy, but without sacriﬁcing the convergence to the unique viscosity solution.},
